#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### Get the Starter Code
clone the project from https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1

### Development Strategy
1. Run the app from the local machine in a new terminal:

Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 

Python 3: python3 -m http.server 8000

and visit the site in your browser: http://localhost:8000

2. Get the map on the screen using https://www.mapbox.com/install/ or https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key.

3. make the site responsive with different devices using css.

4. make the site accessible.

5. make the site accessible when the user is offline
